		<h1>About Jhon Nash</h1>
		<P> The recent death of John Nash, the mathematician who came up with the idea of the Nash equilibrium, has brought game theory into focus as a mechanism for dealing with interactions in antagonistic situations. A good example ofthis is the simmering conflictbetweenIndia and Pakistan:and let's see how the theory may predict how the two behave.</p>

	   	    <p>That, of course, is not an optimal outcome: the best outcome for both is they both get away with the light one-year sentence. Unfortunately, the most likely outcome is that they both betray each other. That is a Nash Equilibrium: a stable situation which is non-optimal, but in which neither party will dare to unilaterally change its strategy because of the possibility of a worse outcome.Now consider two parties that deal with each other repeatedly in the same game: a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game. A long-running buyer-seller relationship can be considered an example. Diplomatic moves between two rival countries can be another example. In these repeated games, each party has information about how the other player acted in previous games, and that can be used to predict their behaviour this time around</p>
